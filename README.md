# thumbvideo
Asynchronous Node.js module to create, cache and fetch thumbnails from
videos. It uses **ffmpeg** to generate thumbnails and **ES6 Promise**.

The API is more reliable now and is unlikely to have major changes before stable release.

Healthy criticisms, feature requests and issues are welcome.
